## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

### Minecraft version

This plugin runs on a Minecraft version 1.16+.

## What is a Shared Health?

With this plugin, everyone shares the health bar. If you die, everyone dies!

## How to use it

- drag the .jar file from the [Release tab](https://github.com/Matistan/SharedHealth/releases) to your plugins folder on your server.
- type `/sharedhealth start` to start the game of shared health, and stop it using `/sharedhealth stop`
- if you don't want to play with every player on the server, change the rule `playWithEveryone` to false, and choose the players using `/sharedhealth add` command

## Commands

- `/sharedhealth add <player> <player> ... ` - adds players
- `/sharedhealth add @a` - adds all players
- `/sharedhealth remove <player> <player> ... ` - removes players
- `/sharedhealth remove @a` - removes all players
- `/sharedhealth start` - starts the game
- `/sharedhealth reset` - resets the game
- `/sharedhealth list` - shows a list of players in the game of shared health
- `/sharedhealth help` - shows a list of shared health commands

## Configuration Options

Edit the `plugins/SharedHealth/config.yml` file to change the following options:

| Key                 | Description                                                                                                 | Type    | recommended                                                   |
